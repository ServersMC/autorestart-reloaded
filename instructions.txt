Introduction:
	AutoRestart-Reloaded plugin is just a "Messenger". It tells the players, when the server will
restart, or it is estimating when the server will restart. The server restarting functions are done by a
third party process such as the Batch file, Bash (.sh) file, or  MultiCraft.


Installation: (Without MultiCraft)
	Inside the folder is a config.yml file, a instuctions.txt, the startup file (Windows)
start_server.bat file, or (Other Unix OS) start_server.sh file, and a plugin (TitleAPI.jar) used to run
the popups. The plugin will not run without this plugin.
	First, move the startup file to the same folder of your Minecraft Server jar file. This could be
Spigot.jar, Bukkit.jar, CraftBukkit.jar, or whatever you have decided to name that file. Right click the
startup file you have moved, and edit it. Inside the file make sure to change FILENAME to the EXACT same
file that your server uses. (Example: Spigot.jar). You have to add the (.jar) extension.



Installation (Continued): (With MutliCraft)
	Go into your Scheduled Tasks inside your MultiCraft panel, and add a command where the server will
restart every certain amount of minutes/hours. (Make sure the interval is the same as your config.yml).
	Please note that I do not have MutliCraft to test this feature. If you have MultiCraft please message
me what you did for this plugin to work so I can refine these instructions.


Installation (Continued): (With or Without MultiCraft)
	Next, move your TitleAPI.jar file from the AutoRestart folder to your plugins folder. This plugin is
essential for AutoRestart to properly function.
	Finally, edit the config.yml file, have fun, and make your server more convenient and faster by
saving RAM, and/or adding this cool feature to make your server look more professional than before!


Conclusion:
	I want to apologize for all of those having trouble installing AutoRestart, also I'm sorry for not
updating the plugin as regularly, I have been busy with work, and school so I'm never on my computer
even for gaming, searching, or purchasing. The only reason I have used my PC is for school. Thank you all
for using my plugin, and I would love to visit your server seeing you use my plugin. Enjoy this unique
up-to-date plugin, and happy gaming.

Thank you.
